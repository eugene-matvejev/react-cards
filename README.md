# react.js tech test

as a magician, I'd like to shuffle, draw and sort cards so that I can perform magic tricks. 

### acceptance criteria 

- can I shuffle the deck of cards?
- can I draw any given number of cards from the deck, with the cards being removed from the original deck?
- can I draw any given number of cards from the deck, and then sort the drawn cards, with the cards being removed from the original deck?
- sorted cards are sorted by suit: clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds; then by value: ace is highest.

### back of card (technical constraints)
- simple User Interface is fine – though we’d love to see what you’re capable of!
- use best in industry engineering practices. 
- ensure that your code is well tested. Guidance Please provide us with build/test/run instructions as well as the codebase, preferably via [github](https://github.com). 
  * it took us around 3 hours to do this, so please use this as an indicator of effort required
